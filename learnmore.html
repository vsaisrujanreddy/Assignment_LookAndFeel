                The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent
                regulatory agency of the United States whose purpose is to
                enforce campaign finance law in United States federal elections.
                Created in 1974 through amendments to the Federal Election
                Campaign Act,[4] the commission describes its duties as "to
                disclose campaign finance information, to enforce the provisions
                of the law such as the limits and prohibitions on contributions,
                and to oversee the public funding of Presidential elections."

              <h3 class="animated fadeInDown">History</h3>
              <p class="animated fadeInRight">
                The FEC was established in 1974, in an amendment of the Federal
                Election Campaign Act (FECA), to enforce and regulate campaign
                finance law.[8] Initially, its six members were to be appointed
                by both houses of Congress and the President, reflecting a
                strong desire for Congress to retain control.[8] Two
                commissioners were to be appointed by the President pro tempore
                of the Senate and two by the Speaker of the House of
                Representatives, each upon recommendation by the respective
                majority and minority leaders in that chamber, and the last two
                appointed by the President.[8] They were to be confirmed by both
                Houses of Congress, rather than only by the Senate.[8] The
                appointment process was invalidated in 1976, in Buckley v.
                Valeo, when the Supreme Court held that the commissioners of the
                FEC were “Officers of the United States” under the Appointments
                Clause, and must be nominated by the President and confirmed by
                the Senate.[8] Congress then amended the FECA to comply with
                Buckley and now the six FEC commissioners are nominated by the
                President and confirmed by the Senate.[8] Since 1990, the FEC
                has grown more polarized, with considerable deadlocks in
                decision-making.

              <h3 class="animated fadeInDown">Membership</h3>
              <p class="animated fadeInRight">
                The commission consists of six members appointed by the
                president and confirmed by the Senate. Each member is appointed
                for a six-year term, each ending on April 30, and two seats are
                subject to appointment every two years.[10] However, members
                continue to serve after their terms would expire until a
                replacement is confirmed,[11] but may resign at any time. By
                law, no more than three commissioners can be members of the same
                political party, which was intended to ensure that decisions are
                nonpartisan.[12] The commission has not had six members since
                the resignation of Ann Ravel (Democratic) in March 2017.
                President Donald Trump nominated James E. Trainor III
                (Republican) on September 14, 2017, for a term expiring April
                30, 2023,[13] to enable replacement for Lee Goodman
                (Republican), who resigned in February 2018, creating a second
                vacancy. When Matthew Petersen (Republican) resigned on August
                31, 2019, the commission had only three members, and was unable
                to conduct most of its regulatory and decision-making functions
                due to lack of a quorum.[11] Trainor was confirmed by the Senate
                on May 19, 2020, restoring the commission's quorum of four.[14]
                One meeting was held online, due to the coronavirus pandemic, on
                June 18, 2020.[15] On June 25, however, Caroline Hunter
                (Republican) resigned, effective July 3, with the result that
                the commission once again lacked a quorum.[16] On December 9,
                three new members were confirmed by the Senate.[17] The chair of
                the commission rotates among the members each year, with no
                member serving as chair more than once during a six-year term.
                However, a member may serve as chair more than once if they
                serve beyond the six-year mark and no successor is appointed;
                for example, Ellen L. Weintraub (Democratic) was chair in 2003,
                2013 and 2019.[18] The chair of the commission in 2020 is James
                Trainor, who was elected on June 18, 2020, succeeding Caroline
                Hunter.
